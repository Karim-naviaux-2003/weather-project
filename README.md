### API Used
I have utilized the OpenWeatherMap API, accessible through this link: [https://openweathermap.org/current](https://openweathermap.org/current)

### Which Version of the API Was Used?
I utilized version 2.5 (API current).

### Where Was It Used?
I incorporated it in a file named `WeatherPage.js` in the `Pages` folder within the `Components` folder.

### How to Use It?
To make an HTTP request (only GET for now), specify values for the first parameter (lat) and the second parameter (long) in the link. Additionally, you need another parameter to use the same version as me (explained in the next point).

I developed a function named `Makefetch` in the file `fetch.js` within the `utils` folder of my project. This function takes the URL as a parameter. The URL should be the one for using the API.

### What Do You Need to Use It?
Firstly, you need to insert your personal API key generated by their website after creating an account on OpenWeatherMap.
